# Endless Shore Campaign

## Boat story completed

  
The world is an ocean with no land.  
A boy grows up in a small boat in a comfortable sea  
He leaves and keeps boarding/ unboarding different ships in larger and larger raft cities  
The captains of these ships are often cruel and exploitative of those working onboard.  
They punish by casting people off if they won’t work hard enough  
The boy longs to become a fish, flowing with the current not desperately keeping from drowning  
The people talk of a sacred place called “land” where you can stand up and not drown, but no one owns the land so you can’t be thrown off by the captain.  
The boy goes into a boat claims to be able to build other boats... they can build parts of boats but not the real thing. The captain is a big crazy but idealist about a nirvana where the people can just make new boats without needed to attack, destroy and rebuild them.  
The printing boat,s crew and also financiers are frustrated. The crew speaks of mutany, but the financiers replace the captains. The new captain acts empathetic to the crew and claims to be one of them but has a “throw off” and the boy + 20%  
The biggest armada is now headed by an insane captain. They start bizarre wars and refuse to acknowledge them.  
The boy learns to swim and uses his making skills on a few other boats. Makes a little trinket for the patrol ship\( and old patroller\)  
Patrollers often find shipless people in the water and pull them up and “rent them” or just drown them for fun. The crew hate patrollers.  
The boy finds another finance ship/ raft and builds scroll sharing systems for sharing  
A great storm ravages the raft city and many fall overboard. They must stay indoors or risk dying, but many deny the storm has really that bad.  
Anti - patroller sentiment builds and sparks a “great mutany” across many ships, the crew either throw the captain overboard, throw them in the brig or force them into “co-labor”  
Many of the mutineers have witch/ magical girl powers and are being ambushed, terrorized by the patrolmen. They resort to stronger, but demonic aligned blood/fire magic in retaliation. Many love to decry older - previous sorcerers and leaders who are esteemed as still terrible and weak.  
There are no captains on those ships but they’re sometimes lead by cruel, militant mutineers who use their new found power to seek retribution against former, higher ranked grudges.  
The boy meets someone in the mutany and falls in love. Realizes that there may not no land and the new no-captains are just as bad as the old ones, but also decides he doesn’t need land anymore because he has them.  
They jump off and swim...
