# The Endless Shore

Buoys and Reefs

The Fleets- All boats and shits capable of navigating the sea

The Captains- those who own a boat are called a captain and they say "like a god, to float with ease" each ship and everything on it is considered property of the captain. Some are deemed "honorable" and can settle legal disputes between captains. Each fleet is headed by the "most honorable" of the captains who has the final say over all decisions for the fleet

Crew- a variety of positions required to operate a boat. they may be held in high esteem or be treated very harshly. Crew cannot become a captain with an honorable captain blessing the handoff of the shit

The Patrolmen- The standard force of most fleets, they patrol their waters and often locate "floats" whom they may abuse

Reed people- Most of the population are considered Reed or Raft people. they live on large wooden rafts that capture fresh water and hold crops. the raft networks are fast and often associated with buoys, reefs or large immobile ship fleets

"floaters"- a derogatory term for people caught floating in the water \(general dead but sometimes alive\) they  are frequently forced into labor in exchange for their rescue. Many people are trapped in cycles of being crew, thrown overboard or mutiny.





The Great Mutiny- The idea that one day the people will rise up, overthrow the captains and take charge of the fleet

The Land of the Heart- the belief that somewhere in the sea there is a great rock where everyone can stand and no one drowns in the deep cold waters.
