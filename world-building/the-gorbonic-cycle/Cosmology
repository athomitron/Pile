The World is layered between the Otherworld and our realm

The OverWorld
The otherworld is both above, below and overlapping this world.

Above are the Heavens- Distant and Empty

The otherworld is beneath, and different layers are comprised of different properties but connected by a series of caves, rivers and other bodies of water.

Beneath are the two hells

The Abyss is an roof over end endless void, it is dark, cold and anything that enters it eventually turns to mist and vanishes into it

The Inferno is a series of columns of fire that stretch from the deep in the abyss into the Overworlds above.

Some of the fames even reach into heaven, but in very controlled spaces.

Unconfined in the abyss is lashes and fans out, collapsing into chaos endlessly.
