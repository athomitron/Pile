# Gorbo

Notes:

Gorbo the idiot god a food you love gone bad the cowbirds of the gods The Brood parasitic of the gods

a parasite as a language

symbols that replace true meaning

all consuming

untrustworthy

Background:

At some point in human prehistory an entity called Gorbo offered to kill a demon in return for sharing his symbols with the elfs

his symbols soon took over and the other gods were forgotten

The wizard rebellion is said to have killed gorbo in the center of the maelstrom

his symbols are a parasitic virus of language- to speak them may cause infection- to write them is incurable

his true nature is the symbols themselves

hey are worms of letters
