# Maelstrom

A massive, sprawling metropolis with an unclear founding but mostly managed by orcish politics

Economy- Slave trade, black markets, Insurance, New War

War- the traditional culture of the orcs accepts violence as being the purest and most righteous path towards resolving conflict. Power and Vengeance are worshipped, and the concept of reason, empathy, tolerance and mercy are seen as pathetic human values.  

Maelstrom was a meeting point and moment of peace between the orc bands which slowly developed into a permanent settlement as the bands grew richer with bounty and less nomadic in lifestyle.

Maelstrom boomed with the creation of New War and the orcish system of insurance.

New War- art contest as a means of resolving conflict with community arbitration and judgement

The NightMayor and DayMayor

The Well- sacred and supposedly magic spring the orcs camped at as the original Maelstrom
