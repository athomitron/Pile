The Conceptual Game (Alpha version 001)
{needs better name to entice players to play}

Players-

A player is someone who is invited to play,  agrees to become a player and they hears the rules. A player cannot quit being a player unless they forget that they are a player.

Rules -
A player is someone who understands and agrees upon the rules of the game.
A player starts at level 1. 
A contest is happens when two players mutually identify each other and agree to have a contest. Players only need to identify one another and a contest automatically begins.
A contest must happen truthfully and both players must agree on the terms and who the winner is.

The winner of a contest is whoever has the highest level.
If both players are the same level, the player with their birthday coming soonest is the winner.
each time the player beats another player in a contest, the winner may invite a new player to join the game and gain one level. Players may only invite an equal number of new players as their current level minus one (unless they are the first player).
the loser gains -Charity-(.5) worth of a level (but does not gain the level until they win enough charity points to reach a whole number.
-Charity- may be updated in the future to a new ratio (always less than or equal to .5)
 
Players must record their contests, levels and invites in a shared leger. (potentally to be split off into a future repository)

This is the player leger = 1 player (chronological) Date - Name - current level (update after each consecutive win and new player added) - Invited by (player name)
